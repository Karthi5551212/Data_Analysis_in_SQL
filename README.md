## Description:
worked on a comprehensive data analysis project using SQL to explore and analyze the AirlineDB, a database containing flight-related data including transactions, tickets, flight schedules, airports, and aircraft information. The project involved extracting actionable insights and solving real-world business problems for an airline. Key analyses included:

### Seat Allocation
Identified the least allocated seat number across all flights.
### Passenger Revenue
Analyzed month-wise highest and lowest paying passengers, including passenger names and IDs.
### Journey Analysis
Discovered travel details for non-stop and return journeys.
### Boarding Pass Issues
Flagged tickets without boarding passes for further investigation.
### Flight Analysis
Found the longest flight and explored its details.
### Geographic Insights
Listed airports based on specific time zones and identified airports with the maximum number of departures.
### Flight Performance
Analyzed specific brands of flights that experienced cancellations or delays.
### Cancellation Insights
Identified the airport with the highest number of canceled flights and passengers who received refunds due to cancellations.
### Aircraft Range
Investigated the details of the flight with the highest range.
This project showcased my ability to work with complex relational databases, design and optimize queries, and deliver data-driven insights for operational improvements in the airline industry.
